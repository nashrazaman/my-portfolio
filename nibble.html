            Nibble is an app targeted for college students who <br>have tight budgets for food! 
            As a college student<br>  I have often struggled to decide what to cook for dinner <br> with 
            the groceries I have at home. With Nibble, your <br> virtual pantry, you can generate 
            recipes with ingredients <br> available at home! To update the app, you could either <br>manually 
            add your ingredients or take a picture of your  <br> receipt from the grocery store, and the app 
            will<br> automatically add it to your pantry.

            Nibble was my capstone project, my team and I used <br> python flask for the backend and react 
            native for the <br>front end. I was the project manager and front end lead <br> for this project and was 
            responsible for coming up with <br> the UI/UX of the app and building the front end of the app. <br>I also 
            helped assist in building the API points and testing! <br> While the app remains unfinished, we managed <br>
            to finish our MVP (minimum viable product) for the app. <br> You can take a look  at our code <a href="https://github.com/orgs/4BitsInANibble/repositories">here</a>!<br>
